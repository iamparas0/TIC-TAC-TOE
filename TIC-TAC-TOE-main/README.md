# **Tic Tac Toe Game** 🕹️

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built with **React**. It allows two players to take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid. The player who successfully places three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game. If all cells are filled with no winner, the game results in a draw.
